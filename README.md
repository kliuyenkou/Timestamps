# Timestamps
 This is a simple timetracker, where users can track time they spent on a project. Users can invite others to collaborate on a project (backend ready, frontend under construction). Each user can generate a report about their work, about the team's work (under construction). Projects can be logically deleted (archived). There is notification system. Users working on the project, receive messages when the project is archived or restored from the archive. Also users recieve invitation to join project. The project uses a three-layer architecture, DAL, BLL, PL. Authentication is based on the ASP.NET Identity.
